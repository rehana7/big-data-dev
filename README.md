# Rehana Naguru 

## Current: 
I am currently pursuing Masters in Applied Computer Science at Northwest Missouri State University. My course started in Fall-2021. 


## Background: 
I am from India, a place with multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and multi-religious society. 
I accomplished my undergraduate in Computer Science from S.V University. I had an experience of 2.5 years in Tata Consultancy Services. I also had an experience of Lecturer. In my free time I would like to solve puzzles. 

## Plans:

I would like to work as a full-stack developer. As I had an experince of Salesforce, it increased my attention on it. 
Learning new technologies gives a lot of fun. I would like to secure a challenging position that will provide an oppurtunity to learn, perform, excel and offer growth for self as well as organization.
